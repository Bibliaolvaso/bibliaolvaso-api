# This file configures the New Relic Agent.  New Relic monitors
# Ruby, Java, .NET, PHP, and Python applications with deep visibility and low overhead.

# Here are the settings that are common to all environments
common: &default_settings
  # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================

  # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic
  # account.  This key binds your Agent's data to your account in the
  # New Relic service.
  license_key: <%= ENV['NEWRELIC_KEY'] %>

  # Agent Enabled (Ruby/Rails Only)
  # Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run.
  # Default is 'auto' which means the agent will install and run only
  # if a valid dispatcher such as Mongrel is running.  This prevents
  # it from running with Rake or the console.  Set to false to
  # completely turn the agent off regardless of the other settings.
  # Valid values are true, false and auto.
  #
  # agent_enabled: auto

  # Application Name Set this to be the name of your application as
  # you'd like it show up in New Relic. The service will then auto-map
  # instances of your application into an "application" on your
  # dashboard page. If you want to map this instance into multiple
  # apps, like "AJAX Requests" and "All UI" then specify a semicolon
  # separated list of up to three distinct names, or a yaml list.
  # Defaults to the capitalized RAILS_ENV or RACK_ENV (i.e.,
  # Production, Staging, etc)
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   app_name:
  #       - Ajax Service
  #       - All Services
  #
  app_name: Bibliaolvasó

  # When "true", the agent collects performance data about your
  # application and reports this data to the New Relic service at
  # newrelic.com. This global switch is normally overridden for each
  # environment below. (formerly called 'enabled')
  monitor_mode: true

  # Developer mode should be off in every environment but
  # development as it has very high overhead in memory.
  developer_mode: false

  # The newrelic agent generates its own log file to keep its logging
  # information separate from that of your application. Specify its
  # log level here.
  log_level: info

  # Optionally set the path to the log file This is expanded from the
  # root directory (may be relative or absolute, e.g. 'log/' or
  # '/var/log/') The agent will attempt to create this directory if it
  # does not exist.
  # log_file_path: 'log'

  # Optionally set the name of the log file, defaults to 'newrelic_agent.log'
  # log_file_name: 'newrelic_agent.log'

  # The newrelic agent communicates with the service via https by default.  This
  # prevents eavesdropping on the performance metrics transmitted by the agent.
  # The encryption required by SSL introduces a nominal amount of CPU overhead,
  # which is performed asynchronously in a background thread.  If you'd prefer
  # to send your metrics over http uncomment the following line.
  # ssl: false

  # Proxy settings for connecting to the New Relic server.
  #
  # If a proxy is used, the host setting is required.  Other settings
  # are optional. Default port is 8080.
  #
  # proxy_host: hostname
  # proxy_port: 8080
  # proxy_user:
  # proxy_pass:

  # The agent can optionally log all data it sends to New Relic servers to a
  # separate log file for human inspection and auditing purposes. To enable this
  # feature, change 'enabled' below to true.
  # See: https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/audit-log
  audit_log:
    enabled: false

# Application Environments
# ------------------------------------------
# Environment-specific settings are in this section.
# For Rails applications, RAILS_ENV is used to determine the environment.
# For Java applications, pass -Dnewrelic.environment <environment> to set
# the environment.

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide newrelic configuration settings for these environments here.

development:
  <<: *default_settings
  # Turn off communication to New Relic service in development mode (also
  # 'enabled').
  # NOTE: for initial evaluation purposes, you may want to temporarily
  # turn the agent on in development mode.
  monitor_mode: false

  # Rails Only - when running in Developer Mode, the New Relic Agent will
  # present performance information on the last 100 transactions you have
  # executed since starting the mongrel.
  # NOTE: There is substantial overhead when running in developer mode.
  # Do not use for production or load testing.
  developer_mode: true

  # Enable textmate links
  # textmate: true

test:
  <<: *default_settings
  # It almost never makes sense to turn on the agent when running
  # unit, functional or integration tests or the like.
  monitor_mode: false

# Turn on the agent in production for 24x7 monitoring. NewRelic
# testing shows an average performance impact of < 5 ms per
# transaction, you can leave this on all the time without
# incurring any user-visible performance degradation.
production:
  <<: *default_settings
  monitor_mode: true

# Many applications have a staging environment which behaves
# identically to production. Support for that environment is provided
# here.  By default, the staging environment has the agent turned on.
staging:
  <<: *default_settings
  monitor_mode: true
  app_name: Bibliaolvasó (Staging)
